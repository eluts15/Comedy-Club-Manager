## Setup Instructions

This application relies on Firebase.  If you would like to clone and replicate this project it requires generating a free api key.
To do this create a Google account if you don't have one already. Once this is done, you should have access to the Firebase Console located in the top right corner (next to your account images.)
Navigating to the console, there should be an option, "Add project". Fill out necessary information to create your database.
Once this is done, you are navigated to a dashboard where you can request an api key. (The options are "Add Firebase to your iOS app", "Add Firebase to your Android app", "Add Firebase to your web app." Click on the right-most one to generate an api key for a web application.)

This will give you something that resembles:

export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
  };

You will need to add your own api key obviously.

Setting up in angular for Firebase import the following in your app.module.ts


import { masterFirebaseConfig } from './api-keys';
import { AngularFireModule } from 'angularfire2';
import { AngularFireDatabaseModule } from 'angularfire2/database';

...

export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: masterFirebaseConfig.apiKey,
  authDomain: masterFirebaseConfig.authDomain,
  databaseURL: masterFirebaseConfig.databaseURL,
  storageBucket: masterFirebaseConfig.storageBucket
};

@NgModule({
  ...
